## Setting up the Database

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the database, make sure you have [Database System] installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Database System Official Website].

### Database Configuration

1. **Create a Database:**
   - Open [Database System] and create a new database named `usermanagement`.

2. **Database Connection URL:**
   - Obtain the connection URL for your database. It typically follows the format:
     ```
     [database-type]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database-name]
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variable:**
   - In the project directory, create a `.env` file.
   - Add the following line with your actual database connection Details:
     ```
     DATABASE_DETAILS=[your-database-connection-details]
     ```

### Verify Database Setup

1. **Start the Application:**
   - Run the application using the appropriate command:
     ```bash
     [start-command, e.g., npm start or python manage.py runserver]
     ```
   - Access the application in your web browser.

2. **Verify Database Connection:**
   - Ensure that the application connects to the database without errors.


Now, your User Management System is connected to the database, and you can start managing users and roles.
